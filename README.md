## TmCGPT Debugger -React

This is the WebApp version of the [ChatGPT client app for the desktop](https://github.com/Jun-Murakami/TmCGPTD-2.0).
It shares logs with the desktop version and is intended for use on smartphones.

- Setting the OpenAI API key is required for chatting (not necessary for viewing logs only).
- Its distinguishing feature is automatically compressing lengthy conversation logs in the background, allowing for long conversations while maintaining quality.
